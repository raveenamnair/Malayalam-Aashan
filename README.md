# Malayalam Aashan
Malayalam Aashan is a Desktop Application written in Python that allows 
users to learn how to read and write in Malayalam, the language of Kerala, India. This application was a way
for me to personally learn my native tongue so I could improve my reading and writing skills. This is version 1 of my
desktop application, more features to come soon.
