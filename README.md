# Malayalam Aashan
Malayalam Aashan is a Desktop Application written in Python that allows 
users to learn how to read and write in Malayalam, the language of Kerala, India. This application was a way
for me to personally learn my native tongue so I could improve my reading and writing skills. The application starts off with you 
creating an account so your progress can be kept track of. Then you have the option of either learning alphabets or reviewing them
in a flashcard form. After you feel sufficient, you are then welcome to take practice quizzes and then unit quizzes to increase your 
comprehension level and get more difficult words to practice with.

# Installing

If you would like to install the app, make sure you have these modules installed through pip as well:

speech_recognition

To run the application properly, make sure you run the files in this order:
webscrapping_one.py, webscrapping_two.py, webscrapping_three.py (all of these initialize the database), clean_database.py (to fix an errors that may have occurred while inserting values to database), gui_controller.py (to run GUI application). With these steps, application should run smoothly. Please contact me if you find any issues while handling these actions.
